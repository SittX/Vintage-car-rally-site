                        Scenic Tours give classic car owners the opportunity to use their pride and joy on a ‘rally
                        style’
                        event, but without the competitive element and the use of overly rough surfaces.
                        <br>
                        As the title suggests, they use routes mainly on smooth non-damaging roads through outstanding
                        countryside and stop off at interesting places, making them great whether you’re behind the
                        wheel or
                        not.

                        Timing is only used in order to spread cars out on the road so that crews can enjoy the scenery

                        the
                        emphasis is on relaxed, social fun in the company of like-minded people.

                        The HRCR in association with KGD Industrial & Monit Tripmeters, operates a Scenic Tour Series of
                        specially selected and highly recommended events that are guaranteed to be great value, good fun
                        and
                        offering a range of great prizes for HRCR members. These are staged all around the country and
                        take
                        place throughout the year.

                        to challenge yourself on the UK’s

                        <br>
                        But this is not purely a playground for the experts. The sport welcomes novice crews and a lot
                        of support and camaraderie is shared amongst competitors. Within the HRCR there are many who can
                        offer guidance and assistance to be part of this most exciting form of historic rallying.

                        Preparation is more comprehensive given the nature of the activity and certainly safety is on
                        par with the standards required for modern stage rallying. This also involves safety clothing
                        and protection for the crew.

                        Hill climbs and sprints offer an affordable way to enjoy competition. With the courses ranging
                        from the famous, twisty and narrow hill climb courses to some fast, flowing airfield tests and
                        even a chance to compete on well-known racing circuits, there is a venue to suit every skill and
                        aspiration.

                        Hill climbs and sprints see cars and drivers competing singly against the clock and all types of
                        vehicle are catered for so any rally car can be accommodated – even extending to Group B cars.
                        <br>
                        Competitors take it in turns (usually running in class order) to drive the course and cars can
                        be shared by two drivers, reducing costs even further. A 16 year old can compete on speed events
                        so this is a good chance to double drive and bring on the next generation of competitors.

                        <br>
                        Regulations allow for almost all vehicles from standard road cars through to bespoke racing cars
                        and the level of car preparation varies depending on the class car, but for standard or road
                        rally cars the level of preparation is minimal. In addition, the competition licence used for
                        road rallying (National B Rally ) is also suitable for hill climbs and sprint.
                        <br>
                        Similar to stage rallying, drivers are required to wear homologated overalls, helmet (plus visor
                        / goggles in open cars) and flame resistant gloves whilst taking part.
