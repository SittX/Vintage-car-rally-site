                        Scenic Tours give classic car owners the opportunity to use their pride and joy on a ‘rally
                        style’
                        event, but without the competitive element and the use of overly rough surfaces.
                        <br>
                        As the title suggests, they use routes mainly on smooth non-damaging roads through outstanding
                        countryside and stop off at interesting places, making them great whether you’re behind the
                        wheel or
                        not.
                        <br>
                        The routes use simple navigation – usually a roadbook of simple Tulip diagrams which eliminates
                        the
                        need
                        to read a map – on many events code boards or manned passage checks are also included so that
                        you
                        know
                        you’re on the right route.
                        <br>
                        Timing is only used in order to spread cars out on the road so that crews can enjoy the scenery
                        as
                        the
                        emphasis is on relaxed, social fun in the company of like-minded people.
                        <br>
                        You don’t require a competition licence or have special insurance. However, your car does need
                        to be
                        safe and road legal i.e. appropriately taxed, insured and MOT’d where required. All classics are
                        welcome
                        and organisers may also accept ‘modern’ classics.
                        <br>
                        The HRCR in association with KGD Industrial & Monit Tripmeters, operates a Scenic Tour Series of
                        specially selected and highly recommended events that are guaranteed to be great value, good fun
                        and
                        offering a range of great prizes for HRCR members. These are staged all around the country and
                        take
                        place throughout the year.

                        If you want to experience life in the fast lane then welcome to the closed roads and forest
                        tracks of Historic Stage Rallying.
                        <br>
                        These one or two-day events give you the unique opportunity to challenge yourself on the UK’s
                        most famous rally stages ‘flat out’ in your classic.
                        <br>
                        Test your skills on a mixture of asphalt and gravel events – all come complete with plenty of
                        high quality stage miles and a mass of spectators and media coverage, too.
                        <br>
                        But this is not purely a playground for the experts. The sport welcomes novice crews and a lot
                        of support and camaraderie is shared amongst competitors. Within the HRCR there are many who can
                        offer guidance and assistance to be part of this most exciting form of historic rallying.
                        <br>
                        Run to Motorsport UK regulations to provide a level playing field for all, you will need to be a
                        member of an Motorsport UK recognised motor club (like the HRCR), hold an Motorsport UK National
                        A or higher grade competition licence and your car will need to comply with the Motorsport UK
                        historic stage rally vehicle categories 1, 2, 3 and 4 (including FIA Appendix K cars) and
                        regulations.
                        <br>
                        Preparation is more comprehensive given the nature of the activity and certainly safety is on
                        par with the standards required for modern stage rallying. This also involves safety clothing
                        and protection for the crew.
                        <br>
                        <!-- The HRCR operate two historic stage rally championships; the Mini Sport Mini Cup Championship –
                        which takes place purely on non-damaging sealed surfaces, and the Stage Masters Challenge –
                        which uses a combination of gravel and asphalt surfaces. Both championships comprise of a number
                        of individual rounds throughout the year, chosen for the quality of their stages, organisation
                        and popularity with crews and spectators too. -->

                        Hill climbs and sprints offer an affordable way to enjoy competition. With the courses ranging
                        from the famous, twisty and narrow hill climb courses to some fast, flowing airfield tests and
                        even a chance to compete on well-known racing circuits, there is a venue to suit every skill and
                        aspiration.
                        <br>
                        Hill climbs and sprints see cars and drivers competing singly against the clock and all types of
                        vehicle are catered for so any rally car can be accommodated – even extending to Group B cars.
                        <br>
                        Though the mileage on the event is limited when compared to taking part in a rally, the cost of
                        competing is much more affordable and drivers still get to enjoy a day out with cars, and with
                        car people.
                        <br>
                        Competitors take it in turns (usually running in class order) to drive the course and cars can
                        be shared by two drivers, reducing costs even further. A 16 year old can compete on speed events
                        so this is a good chance to double drive and bring on the next generation of competitors.
                        <br>
                        Regulations allow for almost all vehicles from standard road cars through to bespoke racing cars
                        and the level of car preparation varies depending on the class car, but for standard or road
                        rally cars the level of preparation is minimal. In addition, the competition licence used for
                        road rallying (National B Rally ) is also suitable for hill climbs and sprint.
                        <br>
                        Similar to stage rallying, drivers are required to wear homologated overalls, helmet (plus visor
                        / goggles in open cars) and flame resistant gloves whilst taking part.
                        <br>
                        On most events drivers are invited to take part in a convoy run or two around the course for
                        drivers to familiarise themselves with the track. Practise runs (normally two) are then taken in
                        class order. Timed runs then take place – usually a minimum of two up to a maximum of four or
                        five. This is the time to concentrate and hone your technique to shave off fractions of a second
                        and home in on the perfect run.
